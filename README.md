# Data-Driven-Insights---Ecommerce-Company

Ecommerce companies like Amazon, Alibaba, and eBay have changed the way the retail industry does business. ShopOnline is an Ecommerce business that operates globally and focuses primarily on gift items. ShopOnline collects data about every transaction made on its web shop.

Data visualization helps in identifying patterns, trends, and correlations that may not be apparent in raw data. Interactive dashboards allow users to drill down into specific data points or time periods, facilitating the discovery of meaningful insights.

The main purpose of this Project is to deliver data-driven insights to ShopOnline - A Ecommerce Company

<h2>Why Data Visualization is Important for Business </h2>
Many reputable companies in the marketplace use data analytics to create interactive dashboards to analyze and summarize their company's products or services. As shown in Figure 1, the interactive dashboard used for further analysis in this section is related to Netflix, a business that mainly operates online and is a dominant player in the on-demand media entertainment industry. Netflix explicitly provides streaming services for its subscribed users. The source documents can be viewed by visiting the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sifeng.zhu/viz/NETFLIXMOVIETVSHOWTableauVizChallenge20202/Netflix.

According to the case of Deloitte (2015), Deloitte proposed distinct types of mass personalization, the most relevant marketing segmentation and service personalization strategy implemented by Netflix correlates with personalized experiences since it uses data analysis and algorithms to customize its subscribers' personalized environment. For instance, concerning users who preoccupy with watching movies, Netflix would only recommend movies on users' Netflix homepage combined with types of movies the users like to watch, such as action movies or documentaries. (See Appendix Figure 1), rather than recommending tv-shows to the users.

Moreover, the concept of different degrees of marketing personalization stated six degrees of personalization. In accordance with this notion, Netflix has also been actively executing account customization and related content personalization. It is because Netflix could accurately recommend other content the user may be interested in by tracking users' previously viewed content, movies, or tv-shows (Lamkhede & Kofler, 2021).

Furthermore, most of the time, Netflix makes targeted recommendations to users about content they might be obsessed with, based on its analysis of the areas of interest users choose when they create the account and users' regular access to movie or tv-shows types.

Netflix integrates these strategies to enhance the customers' personalized experiences, improve customer satisfaction, and build and maintain customer loyalty.

<h2>Section 1: understanding of the business model of gift item ecommerce companies globally</h2>

ShopOnline is an e-commerce company specializing in gift items, providing customized products to customers worldwide. Unlike e-commerce giants Amazon, Alibaba, and eBay, ShopOnline focuses on gift items and does not allow third-party vendors to enter the website to sell their goods. However, in common, the operation model is roughly the same as these e-commerce business giant companies, so that the following will refer to the research based on these companies. Please see Figure 2 for a visualization of the business model canvas dedicated to ShopOnline, which was developed based on analyses of other related e-commerce companies and will be discussed in detail in this section.

<p align="center">

Key partners of ShopOnline should be payment gateway companies, such as online payment security system providers like PayPal. It is a vital partner for e-commerce companies (Moyo, 2022). Also, the key partners include shipping and logistics companies and raw material providers for manufacturing the goods.

Key activities contain B2C services (Pereira, 2022), development and maintenance of the platform, and customer services and support.

Essential resources are basic technology support, server, human resource, and company-owned factories.

Fundamental values that ShopOnline could benefit customers include providing a more convenient shopping experience so customers can order personalized gifts without leaving home (Buddhadev, 2018), global accessibility, and various categories of gifts for customers to choose from. The most valuable proposition is that ShopOnline can provide personalized products and customization services.

ShopOnline could build and maintain customer relationships by improving its customer service and after-sale services, promoting automation and self-service, and offering discounts and coupons for loyal customers.

Customers can purchase from ShopOnline through the official website or mobile application, or people can visit other websites with ShopOnline ads.

The target customers are people with gift-giving needs, shoppers, and the younger generation familiar with online shopping.

ShopOnline's cost structure includes website maintenance and development, which are the most critical and mandatory expenses for an e-commerce business that seeks to stand out from the market (Pereira, 2022). Besides, the placement and promotion of advertisements, the taxes imposed by law, and the salaries of the staff are all fixed expenses of ShopOnline

Since ShopOnline does not endorse third-party vendors to sell products, So ShopOnline's primary revenue comes from the underlying profit of its sales.

Please see Figure 3 for further analysis of the e-commerce industry; it contains a SWOT analysis.

<h2>Section 2: Assumptions about the underlying business model of gift item e-commerce companies </h2>
<br>
1.	Assume that ShopOnline's basic network operation model and sales approach is similar to that of e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay.
<br>
2.	Assume that ShopOnline is already a mature company and has a majority of loyal customers
<br>
3.	Assume that ShopOnline offers personalization and customization services to its customers because, as a company that focuses on selling gift products, it can certainly stand out from its competitors if it can add customization to its services.
<br>
4.	Assume that ShopOnline has its factory to manufacture products for its customers since it does not allow third-party involvement in selling the goods from its website.
<br>
5.	Assume that ShopOnline has these essential key resources such as technical support and human resource to obtain a stable, secure, and attractive platform for users.
<br>
6.	Assume the financial status of ShopOnline enables large-scale advertising and purchase of servers that support global user access to the site

<h2>Section 3: Target customers and popularity of gift e-commerce websites </h2>

The target customers for gift item sellers would be people with an active lifestyle with gift-giving needs, especially the younger generation who are familiar with online shopping (Erlyana & Hartono, 2017). Remarkably, D'Souza (2003) argues that gift-giving has different meanings in Western and Asian cultures. In Asian cultures, companies and individuals are pleased to give gifts, with companies viewing gift-giving as a form of relationship investment and individuals viewing gift-giving as a way to express affection. However, in Western cultures, gift-giving is seen as reciprocity and sometimes misunderstood as a bribe. Therefore, if ShopOnline can develop its business in Asian countries, it might be a favorable choice because there are numerous potential customers.

The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 have indirectly changed people's shopping habits, from preferring to shop in physical stores to shopping online (UNCTAD, 2022). Therefore, gift item e-commerce websites will grow increasingly popular as people's shopping habits change.


<h2>Section 4: Motivations for buying gift items online
 </h2>

 The progressive and global nature of the internet has rapidly evolved into a global phenomenon, allowing consumers to browse products on the internet and choose from tens of thousands of options. This way of shopping brings positive outcomes to many customers since they can enjoy a more convenient and time-saving way to shop (Kumar & Thakur, 2016). According to Goodwin, Smith, and Spiggle (1990), individuals purchase gifts purposefully, with most people giving gifts to commemorate important life events such as marriage anniversaries and Christmas, or to build and maintain interpersonal or corporate relationships.

The motivation for people to buy gifts online is that they can browse through various types of gifts via the internet and choose what they want, which is a more appropriate way to do the shopping for people with busy daily lives and work. In addition, since most online stores have artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze customers, reducing the time customers spend searching for product information, an e-commerce business can make accurate product recommendations by the terms consumers have searched for (Kumar & Thakur, 2016). For example, recommend jewelry and flowers for guys who want to give gifts to their girlfriends. Therefore, online gift-item merchants can immensely motivate people who need to buy gifts to place orders online.
