# Data-Driven-Insights---Ecommerce-Company

Ecommerce companies like Amazon, Alibaba, and eBay have changed the way the retail industry does business. ShopOnline is an Ecommerce business that operates globally and focuses primarily on gift items. ShopOnline collects data about every transaction made on its web shop.

Data visualization helps in identifying patterns, trends, and correlations that may not be apparent in raw data. Interactive dashboards allow users to drill down into specific data points or time periods, facilitating the discovery of meaningful insights.

The main purpose of this Project is to deliver data-driven insights to ShopOnline - A Ecommerce Company

<h2>Why Data Visualization is Important for Business </h2>
Many reputable companies in the marketplace use data analytics to create interactive dashboards to analyze and summarize their company's products or services. As shown in Figure 1, the interactive dashboard used for further analysis in this section is related to Netflix, a business that mainly operates online and is a dominant player in the on-demand media entertainment industry. Netflix explicitly provides streaming services for its subscribed users.

According to the case of Deloitte (2015), Deloitte proposed distinct types of mass personalization, the most relevant marketing segmentation and service personalization strategy implemented by Netflix correlates with personalized experiences since it uses data analysis and algorithms to customize its subscribers' personalized environment. For instance, concerning users who preoccupy with watching movies, Netflix would only recommend movies on users' Netflix homepage combined with types of movies the users like to watch, such as action movies or documentaries. (See Appendix Figure 1), rather than recommending tv-shows to the users.

Moreover, the concept of different degrees of marketing personalization stated six degrees of personalization. In accordance with this notion, Netflix has also been actively executing account customization and related content personalization. It is because Netflix could accurately recommend other content the user may be interested in by tracking users' previously viewed content, movies, or tv-shows (Lamkhede & Kofler, 2021).

Furthermore, most of the time, Netflix makes targeted recommendations to users about content they might be obsessed with, based on its analysis of the areas of interest users choose when they create the account and users' regular access to movie or tv-shows types.

Netflix integrates these strategies to enhance the customers' personalized experiences, improve customer satisfaction, and build and maintain customer loyalty.
